# Instructions
In order to succesffully complete this project you will need to implement your own blockchain (or distributed ledger) platform. 

### Objective
The main idea behind this project is to implement ledger system that will enable companies to issue digital assets that will have a twin in "real-world".
This means that each physical representation of the asset will have its own digital twin which will replicate its state in real-world.


### Resources
You can use open source projects to run your own distributed ledger. You will need to choose specific asset (you might take any product) and 
implement data structure that will represent its digital twin.
